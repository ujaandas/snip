# Espresso

---
Espresso is a TUI framework for C++ that employs the Elm architecture to give developers a straight-forward API and ease-of-mind. This is very, very, very much inspired by Bubbletea for Golang.

> This is essentially a learning/practice ground of C++ and its stdlib for me! In this repository, there will be missing mutexes, thread un-safety, and lots of (probably) bad C++ practices! Having said that, it is a work in progress, and will hopefully evolve beyond those things. I fully intend for this to be useable, and want to migrate some of my TUIs over to use this framework, I think it'd be really cool.
